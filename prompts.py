QUESTION_CREATOR_TEMPLATE = """Given a conversation history, reformulate the question to make it easier to search from a database. 
For example, if the AI says "Do you want to know the current weather in Istanbul?", and the user answer as "yes" then the AI should reformulate the question as "What is the current weather in Istanbul?".
You shouldn't change the language of the question, just reformulate it. If it is not needed to reformulate the question or it is not a question, just output the same text.
